## What Argon is?

Argon is a noble gas.
"Argon" comes from Greek "Argon", neuter of "argos" meaning *lazy* , *idle* or *inactive*.
Argon recieved this name because of its chemical inactivity.

Argon NX is an immutable payload which is injected to your Nintendo Switch via Fusee Gelee exploit.

## Purpose 

The purpose of Argon NX is to stay immutable, so you can always inject it, without caring about other payloads getting updated (Always use ArgonNX for TegraSmash, TegraGUI, TrinkedM0...).

## How can it be immutable?

When Argon NX is injected, it automatically launches the `payload.bin` loacted at `argon` directory on your SD Card root. 

If `payload.bin` is not present or VOLUME DOWN button is pressed on payload injection, Argon NX will list all payloads located at `argon/payloads`, and you will be able to select one of them to launch it.

## Features

- **Autolaunch/autochainload** the payload named `payload.bin` inside `argon` directory in your sd card root.
- If `argon/payload.bin` is not found or `VOLUME_DOWN_BUTTON` is held during ArgonNX injection, ArgonNX will list all the payloads located at `argon/payloads`, so you can select one of them to launch it.
- **Customize payloads' logos**. **Logos must be smaller or equal than 280x280** (See About BMP format section). Example:

```
argon
  â”œâ”€â”€â”€logos
  â”‚     fusee-primary.bmp # Logo for fusee-primary.bin payload
  â”‚     ReiNX.bmp # Logo for ReiNX.bin payload
  â”‚
  â””â”€â”€â”€payloads
        fusee-primary.bin
        ReiNX.bin         
        hekate.bin # Will be rendered using default logo
```

- **Custom backgrounds** can be added by placing `background.bmp` file inside `argon` directory. **The background must be smaller or equal than 1280x720**.
- Take **screenshots** to share your ArgonNX gui. To capture ArgonNX screen tap anywhere with two or more fingers.
- Touch support. Thanks to @pixel-stuck
- Simple tools. (Don't expect tools like the onew built in hekate, argon tools are much more lightweighted and simple, such as reboot options)
- Command Line Interface (CLI) to facilitate the procedure to create bmp files for custom logos and backgrounds.

## About BMP format

The only format supported is **BMP 32 bit ARGB color**.
ArgonNX recommends using a solid background without alpha channel (alpha channel set to 0xFF). Payloads' logos **support alpha channel**.

### Generate new logos and background

ArgonNX provides a useful Command Line Interface (CLI) to create new logos and backgrounds for your payloads using a *jpg* or *png* images.

#### CLI installation

The Argon CLI is written in Python. To install python follow the instructions listed [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/). Once you have python3 installed just type the following commands (These will install the requirements for running the CLI):

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
```

> If you are using Windows visit [Wand's installation page](http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.1/guide/install.html) and follow the steps to install libmagikcwand on Windows.

#### CLI Usage

To generate a new logo use the following command.

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ python argon.py img-to-logo <path-to-png-jpg-img>
```

To generate a new background use the following command.

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ python argon.py generate-background <path-to-png-jpg-img>
```

The CLI stores the outputs of the commands at the recently created (also by the CLI) `sd-files/argon` directory (This directory simulates an sd-card argon structure).

To learn more about the CLI options type:

```bash
$ python argon.py --help
```

## GUI

These images were captured with the **screenshot** feature.

<img src="img/example1.png" alt="example" width="700">

<img src="img/example2.png" alt="example" width="700">

<img src="img/example3.png" alt="example" width="700">

<img src="img/example4.png" alt="example" width="700">

As you can see in the pictures, payloads are displayed in groups of 4 and each group is displayed in a different *payloads* tab.

You can find the logos used in the pictures inside [this directory](img/example-custom/logos) and backgrounds [here](img/example-custom/backgrounds).

## ArgonNX sd card tree

How a full running ArgonNX example looks inside the sd card:

```
argon
â”œâ”€â”€â”€ payloads
â”‚       Atmosphere.bin
â”‚       ReiNX.bin
â”‚       fusee-gelee.bin
â”‚       hekate.bin
â”‚       SXOS.bin
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€ logos
|       Atmosphere.bmp
|       Reinx.bmp
|       hekate.bmp
|       SXOS.bmp
|
â”œâ”€â”€â”€ sys
|       minerva.bso # IMPORTANT if you want a good UX experience
|       resources.argon # IMPORTANT. Binary file containing all render resources except the background and logos
|
â””â”€â”€â”€ background.bmp
```

## Improve performance

ArgonNX can use **minerva training cell** to improve performance.
The use of minerva is optional but recommended. To use minerva just place the compiled `minerva.bso` inside `argon/sys`. The directory `argon/sys` with minerva, is included in `sd-files.zip` in the release section.

To learn more about Minerva Training Cell check its [official repo](https://github.com/CTCaer/minerva_tc).

## Compatibility

This payload will chainload any CFW or payload. 

Some users reported issuses when chainloading SX OS. <small>But with Atmosphere out there... who wants SXOS?</small> ðŸ™„

## Roadmap

1. Config file to manage tabs titles and argon sd card directory tree.
2. More tools inside tools tab.
